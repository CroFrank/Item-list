# My first full CRUD app

After finishing my first Udemy course [Web Dev Bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/share/101W923@ffVioDWE0kJsW8w3tOPqJm6S-nZ_5A6JZvZVPXwSb3lfBxMktZKwSc5xWaNeT-aZLw==/)
I made this very simple CRUD app

### I used:

Express.js ass a framework for Node.js,
Mongoose for modeling data,
EJS for templating

### Try out

App is not hosted anywhere and if you want to run it you need to have installed localy:

- Node
- MongoDB
