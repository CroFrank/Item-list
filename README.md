# My first full CRUD app

After finishing my first Udemy course [Web Dev Bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/share/101W923@ffVioDWE0kJsW8w3tOPqJm6S-nZ_5A6JZvZVPXwSb3lfBxMktZKwSc5xWaNeT-aZLw==/)
I made this very simple CRUD app

### I used:

- Express.js as a framework for Node.js,
- Mongoose for modeling data,
- EJS for templating
- No styling applied

### About app

Here you can create items and give them a price, after that you have option to see all items and manage them whether you want to update or delete them.

### Try out

App is not hosted anywhere and if you want to run it you need to have installed locally:

- Node
- MongoDB

Here are the steps:

1. use "git clone" to get this repo on your machine
1. "npm i" to install all dependencies
1. "npm run items" to get first few items in your DB
1. start MongoDB daemon on your machine with "mongod" command in CLI
1. in another window of CLI run "npm start" and go to localhost:8080
